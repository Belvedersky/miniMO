	/Case
		/Bases

		Print in rigid filament (PLA)
		There are two sets, for rigid and flexible covers
		
			Settings: head diameter 0.4 mm, layer height 0.3 mm, default speed 50 mm/s
			
		/Covers

		Print either in rigid or flexible filament (choose the bases accordingly)

		*Rigid (PLA)
			Settings: head diameter 0.4 mm, layer height 0.3 mm, default speed 50 mm/s

		*Flexible
			Settings: head diameter 0.4 mm, layer height 0.3 mm, default speed 20 mm/s, Retraction 1.20, coasting 0.20
			
	/Connectors_and_Legs
	
	A set of useful parts if you are using the modules without a case

		*hex_leg_10mm.stl: hexagonal leg, 10 mm tall
		
			Settings: head diameter 0.4 mm, layer height 0.2 mm, default speed 30 mm/s  	

		*hex_connector.stl: attaches to the hexagonal legs to group the modules together
	
		*hex_connector_b.stl: same as above, with the hexes rotated 90 degrees 
	
		*hex_legs_stabilizer: locks the legs' rotation
	
			Settings: head diameter 0.4 mm, layer height 0.2 mm, default speed 50 mm/s
			
	/Tools
	
	Parts that help with PCB soldering. The resistor tool allows you to bend the legs to the right measures  
	
		*circuit_placement_jig.stl
			
			Keeps everything in place while soldering
			Settings: layer height 0.2 mm; print with two perimeters and fairly solid infill 
			
		*resistor_bend_tool.stl
		
			Bends the resistors' legs to match the PCB's distance
